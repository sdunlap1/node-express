# Broken App Issues

## Issue 1: Asynchronous Handling in `.map`
  - The code attempts to use `async`/`await` within a `.map` function but does not correctly wait for the asynchronous operations to complete before continuing. This results in an incomplete or incorrect response being sent.

## Issue 2: Error Handling
   - The `catch` block is incomplete and doesn't handle errors properly. It tries to call `next(err)` without actually passing the error to the `next` function.

## Issue 3: Missing Middleware for JSON Parsing
   - The app does not use the `express.json()` middleware, which is necessary for parsing JSON request bodies. This would cause the app to fail to parse incoming JSON data.

## Issue 4: No Server Startup Message
   - There is no log message to indicate that the server has started and is listening, making it difficult to confirm if the server is running successfully.
